# Essential Services Delivery
Essential Services Delivery coordination using Digitally Verifiable Credentials.

This repository contains the build, deployment, and application configurations needed to pull a number of separate applications into a single environment and deploy them as a group of interrelated services.

The resulting services include:

## Proof of Concept Registration applications:
### [SafeEntryBC](https://safeentrybc.vonx.io/)

Allowing Businesses and Citizen's to create "Safe Entry Points" that require the presentation and proof of a set of digitally verifiable credentials in order to authorize access.

This is an instance of [bcgov/dts-esr-demo](https://github.com/bcgov/dts-esr-demo)

### [BC Essential Services Gateway](https://esg.vonx.io/)

Allowing Businesses to register as an Essential Service and in turn be able to issue Essential Service credentials to their employees.

This is an instance of [bcgov/dts-safe-entry-demo](https://github.com/bcgov/dts-safe-entry-demo)

## A Number of Credential Issuer Services

All of the Issuer Services are instances of [bcgov/issuer-kit](https://github.com/bcgov/issuer-kit)

### [Unverified Person Issuer](https://openvp-issuer.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/)

An issuer used to obtain a digital identification credential that is used to authorize access to other services within the PoC.

### [Health Gateway](https://healthbc-issuer.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/)

An issuer used to obtain a personal health number credential that is used to authorize access to other services within the PoC.

### [Essential Services - Organization](https://esr1-issuer.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/)

An issuer used to obtain a business level essential services credential that is used to authorize access to other services within the PoC.

### [Essential Services - Access](https://esr2-issuer.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/)

An issuer used to obtain an essential services access credential that is used to authorize access to other services within the PoC.

### [Med Lab](https://medlab-issuer.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/)

An issuer used to obtain a "lab result" credential that is used to authorize access to other services within the PoC.

## A Sample Set of Safe Entry Points

Each Safe Entry Point is an instance of [bcgov/vc-visual-verifier](https://github.com/bcgov/vc-visual-verifier)

### [Traveller Safe Entry](https://lngpipeline-camp.vonx.io/)

Demonstrates how digitally verifiable credentials can be used to authorize access to or through a point of entry.

### [Essential Service Safe Entry](https://long-term-care-facility.vonx.io/)

Demonstrates how digitally verifiable credentials can be used to provide essential services workers with authorized access to a location or facility.

## Managing the Configurations

This repository contains a set of [openshift-developer-tools](https://github.com/BCDevOps/openshift-developer-tools/tree/master/bin) compatible OpenShift configurations

For information on how to use these configurations with the `openshift-developer-tools scripts` please refer to the documentation; [README.md](https://github.com/BCDevOps/openshift-developer-tools/blob/master/bin/README.md).

### Managing Profiles
The application components are managed using a set of profiles.

To list the profile and their descriptions run:
```
Wade@hvWin10x64 MINGW64 /c/essential-services-delivery/openshift
$ ./manage -p default -e null listProfiles

Loading settings ...
Loading settings from /c/essential-services-delivery/openshift/settings.sh ...

bc - settings.bc.sh
  - Safe Entry application profile
business-registration - settings.business-registration.sh
  - Essential Services Registry application profile
esr1 - settings.esr1.sh
  - Credential issuer profile
esr2 - settings.esr2.sh
  - Credential issuer profile
healthbc - settings.healthbc.sh
  - Credential issuer profile
medlab - settings.medlab.sh
  - Credential issuer profile
openvp - settings.openvp.sh
  - Credential issuer profile
safe-entry-c19 - settings.safe-entry-c19.sh
  - Visual verifier profile
safe-entry - settings.safe-entry.sh
  - Visual verifier profile
default - settings.sh
```

To get the details of a specific profile run:
```
Wade@hvWin10x64 MINGW64 /c/essential-services-delivery/openshift
$ ./manage -p healthbc -e null profileDetails

Loading settings ...
Loading settings from /c/essential-services-delivery/openshift/settings.sh ...
Loading settings from /c/essential-services-delivery/openshift/settings.healthbc.sh ...

healthbc - settings.healthbc.sh
  - Credential issuer profile
  - ../openshift/templates/agent/agent-build.json
  - ../openshift/templates/api/api-build.json
  - ../openshift/templates/db/db-build.json
  - ../openshift/templates/issuer-web/issuer-web-build.json
  - ../openshift/templates/issuer-web-base-image/issuer-web-base-image-build.json
  - ../openshift/templates/wallet/wallet-build.json
  - ../openshift/templates/agent/agent-deploy.yaml
  - ../openshift/templates/api/api-deploy.json
  - ../openshift/templates/db/db-deploy.json
  - ../openshift/templates/issuer-web/issuer-web-deploy.json
  - ../openshift/templates/wallet/wallet-deploy.json
```
We have moved to creating a single wallet pod across all essential services for greater resource sharing. The shared wallet is deployed from the default profile and used by all agents. Please ensure the wallet component is deployed ***BEFORE*** attempting to deploy any issuer agent

To publish or update the settings and configuration for all application profiles you can use the `deployAllProfiles` helper command in the `manage` script, for example;
```
Wade@hvWin10x64 MINGW64 /c/essential-services-delivery/openshift
$ ./manage -p default -e test -u deployAllProfiles
```
- To update all profiles in the test environment.

To publish or update a given profile or a given component within a profile you would use the `genDepls.sh` script. for example;
```
Wade@hvWin10x64 MINGW64 /c/essential-services-delivery/openshift
$ genDepls.sh -p healthbc -e test -u -c issuer-web
```
- To update the `issuer-web` component of the `healthbc` profile.

### Generating New Profiles

For `Credential issuer` and `Visual verifier` there are helper commands that allow you to create the scaffolding for a new profile from an existing one; `createNewIssuerProfile` and `createNewVerifierProfile`.  Examples of how to use these commands can be found in the help documentation for the `manage` script by running;
```
Wade@hvWin10x64 MINGW64 /c/essential-services-delivery/openshift
$ ./manage -h
```

### Creating or Updating Proof Configurations

New or updated proof configurations need to be registered with the vc-authn-oidc-controller associated with the demo environment.  The `manage` script includes a helper command to assist with this task, `configureProof`.  Examples of how to use this command can be found in the help documentation for the `manage` script by running;
```
Wade@hvWin10x64 MINGW64 /c/essential-services-delivery/openshift
$ ./manage -h
```

### Managing the Environments

The `manage` script includes a number of helper commands to help manage the environment.  For a list of these commands and examples of how to use them run;

```
Wade@hvWin10x64 MINGW64 /c/essential-services-delivery/openshift
$ ./manage -h
```
