  <h3><strong>Terms of Service</strong></h3>
  <p class="paragraph">
    This is a proof of concept verifiable credential issuer service that is <bold>NOT</bold> to be used
    for production purposes. The service exists to demonstrate the form of a digital credential of
    personal information a person might receive from a government such as the government of British
    Columbia. Such a credential is a trusted, digital version containing the information commonly issued
    by governments on paper, such as a driver's license or passport. In a "real" version of an
    Issuer service, individuals would complete a verification process of who they are prior
    to the issuance of the digital credential to them, about them. The information in the credential would be
    sourced from the authority that holds that information.

    For more information about Digital Identity and Trust demonstrated with this service, see
    the <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust">BC Digital Trust Information</a> website.
    
    The credential generated from this service is only to be used with proof of concept, non-production
    credential Verifier services.

  <p class="paragraph">
    The basis for this service is <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/issuer-kit">Issuer Kit</a>, an open
    source application that allows the easy configuration of issuers of verifiable credentials.
