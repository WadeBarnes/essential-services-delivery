  <h3><strong>About this Proof of Concept Service</strong></h3>
  <p class="paragraph">
    This is a proof-of-concept service demonstrating a possible workflow for inoculating a series of patients with a vaccine 
    and in parallel, providing them with a record of the inoculation in the form of a digital credential. The digital credential
    can be presented where needed to prove that they have received the vaccine. As much as possible, the use of a digital credential
    matches that of a paper credential, but with much higher security, is impossible to forge and does not rely on a person to
    verify the credential.
  </p>
  <h4>The Scenario</h4>
  <p class="paragraph">
    The user of the service (you!) is participating in a clinic to provide vaccines to a group of patients. You might
    be administering the vaccine, or working in concert with the person administering the vaccine. Your role is to issue the digital
    credential after the vaccine has been given.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    To gain access to this service you must provide proof of your identity. Once in the system
    you will loop through a sequence of inoculating a patient, collecting/entering their name, and issuing them a digital credential about their inoculation.
    The patient will use their digital wallet to scan a QR code on the screen to receive their digital vaccine credential. While you loop back to
    issue another digital credential to another patient, the patient with the credential can go to a site and prove they have been vaccinated.
  </p>
  <h4>Requirements</h4>
  <p class="paragraph">
    To prove your identity to access the system, you and the patients need to have a compatible wallet smartphone app. Instructions to get such a wallet
    are available <a href="https://vonx.io/getwallet" target="_blank">here</a>. Once you have your wallet, you will also need a credential to gain access
    to the service. For this Proof of Concept we're using an "Unverified Person" credential as a stand in for a "real" set of credentials
    that could be used, such as a government ID credential in combination with a medical credential, a health authority authorization, and perhaps even a credential showing
    that you have been trained in giving vaccines. For this service, please go <a href="https://openvp-issuer.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/" target="_blank">here</a>
    to get your "Unverified Person" credential.
  </p>
  <h3><strong>Terms of Service</strong></h3>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Since this is just a proof-of-concept service, the only Terms is an understanding that this is not a real service, that the data being processed is not real, and the data is it not saved by the service.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    A real instance of this kind of service would have a more thorough definition of the responsibilities of the users of the service and on the use of any data collected.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Before proceeding, please make sure you have a compatible digital wallet and an "Unverified Person" credentials as outlined above.
