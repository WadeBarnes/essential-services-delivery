  <h3><strong>About the Vaccine Verification Proof of Concept</strong></h3>
  <p class="paragraph">
    <em>To use this demonstration, you need a BCSC Test user. If you need that, please email <a href="mailto:swcurran@cloudcompass.ca">swcurran@cloudcompass.ca</a> for help.</em>
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    This is a Proof of Concept service. It demonstrates how citizens could be provided with a secure digital “credential” that proves they received a vaccine. Citizens could then present this credential where needed, such as to enter a care home.
  </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
    This digital credential is like a paper certificate, except it’s far more secure, impossible to forge, and easy to verify. For example, it doesn’t require someone to make a human verification of its authenticity—the verification is handled automatically using the latest digital cryptography.
  </p>
  <h4>Example Situation</h4>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Imagine that you have (finally!!) been vaccinated for COVID-19 and you need to prove that to go somewhere — perhaps to enter an extended care facility, a hospital, or to travel to another part of the province or country. You need to have proof of having received a vaccination and a paper credential is not sufficient.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    To get your credential you are going to use the BC Services Card (BCSC) to log into the (a simulation of) the Public Health Gateway, and from there be issued your digital vaccination credential.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Once accepted, you can go somewhere, such as a care home, and digitally present your credential to prove that you have been vaccinated.
  </p>
  <h4>Before You Begin: Technical Requirements</h4>
  <h5>1. Digital wallet to hold credentials</h5>
  <p class="paragraph">
    You will need to have a compatible digital “wallet” on your smartphone to receive credentials to prove they received a vaccine. Therefore, to use this Proof of Concept, <strong>download one of several <a href="https://vonx.io/getwallet">wallet apps</a></strong> to your smartphone.
  </p>
  <h5>2. Credentials to access our (fake) Public Health Gateway</h5>
  <p class="paragraph">
    For this service, you will use a test BC Services Card. There is a link at the top of the page to request one if you need one.
  </p>
  <h3><strong>Terms of Service</strong></h3>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Since this is just a proof-of-concept service, the only Terms is an understanding that this is not a real service, that the data being processed is not real, and the data is it not saved by the service.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    A real instance of this kind of service would have a more thorough definition of the responsibilities of the users of the service and on the use of any data collected.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Before proceeding, please make sure you have a compatible digital wallet and Test BCSC credentials as outlined above.
